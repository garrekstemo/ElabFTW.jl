# PatchAction actions on experiments and items.
#
# The API overloads PATCH /experiments/{id} and PATCH /items/{id} to accept
# either regular field updates or an action directive (`{"action": "lock"}`,
# etc.). Exposed here as named wrappers so callers don't reach for raw
# JSON.

    lock_experiment(id::Int) -> Dict

**Toggle** the lock state on an experiment. A locked experiment cannot be
edited. Calling this on an already-locked experiment unlocks it.

Returns the updated experiment record.

# Example
```julia
lock_experiment(42)    # locks
lock_experiment(42)    # unlocks
```

    pin_experiment(id::Int) -> Dict

**Toggle** the pin state on an experiment. Pinning bookmarks the entity

    timestamp_experiment(id::Int) -> Dict

RFC 3161 timestamp an experiment. Requires the eLabFTW instance to be
configured with a trusted timestamping service. Marks the entity's
`timestamped=1` and records `timestamped_at`.

Returns the updated experiment record.

# Example
```julia

    sign_experiment(id::Int; passphrase, meaning) -> Dict

Cryptographically sign an experiment with the user's signing key.

# Arguments
- `passphrase::String` — the passphrase for the caller's signing key
- `meaning` — an `Int` (10, 20, 30, 40, 50) or `Symbol` (`:approval`,
  `:authorship`, `:responsibility`, `:review`, `:safety`). See
  [`SIGN_MEANING`](@ref).

Requires the eLabFTW instance to be configured with signing keys. If keys
are not configured, the server returns HTTP 500 (this surfaces as a
[`ServerError`](@ref) after retry exhaustion).

# Example
```julia
sign_experiment(42; passphrase="secret", meaning=:approval)
